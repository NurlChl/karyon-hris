/**
 * Company logo used on printed documents.
 *
 * The logo is stored as a **data URL on the document template**, not as a
 * storage key. That looks wasteful next to every other upload in this system,
 * and it is deliberate: payslips and appraisals are printed through the
 * browser's own print dialog, and a print job that has to fetch an image over
 * the network races the dialog. A signed URL makes it worse, because the
 * signature can expire between opening the page and pressing print, and the
 * document silently prints with a missing logo. Inlined bytes always render.
 *
 * The size cap is therefore tight: a letterhead logo has no business being
 * large, and the bytes travel with every template read.
